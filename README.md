# Overview

This automated greenhouse combines sensing, control, and power management into a cohesive network, powered by Arduino Mega 2560 and Raspberry Pi 3B. These microcontrollers process sensor data and manage the greenhouse's adaptive responses. Sensor data is displayed on an online dashboard using Node-RED, secured by a ZeroTier One VPN, with the added benefit of data visualization. The energy management facet of the system adopts a sustainable approach, utilizing a solar panel, a solar charge controller, and a 7.5V battery to ensure smooth and green operation of the system.

This system integrates a variety of sensors to monitor the greenhouse environment. The sensor data is used to control various aspects of the greenhouse such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and pH levels.
